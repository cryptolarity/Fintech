# Smart Contract Use Cases Assignment

#### Step One:
Discuss with your group and pick a general use case to present your findings to the class (it doesn't have to be one covered in class)

i.e. supply chain, cross border payments, finacial services, insurance, digital collectibles, etc.

#### Step Two:

Research with your groups to find sources on any pilot projects or production implementations of your use case.

#### Step Three:

Put together a simple presentation with a few slides reviewing your use case discoveries.

#### Step Four:

Be sure to answer these questions in your presentation:

What is your use case? How does the industry currently function?
Why does this use case need smart contracts? What are the benefits and how would it changes processes? Any drawbacks?
Have any companies or dapps implemented a blockchain solution for this use case? What is the adoption like? (users, volume, funding, press coverage, etc)
